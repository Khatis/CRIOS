# CRIOS - WordPress One-Pager
The code is not tidy. This was made as though it was a personal project.

This was my personal training project in Vilnius Coding School - WEB Development Boot camp style courses.
In the courses, I learned (Chronologically): 
HTML 
CSS
JavaScript
PHP
MySQL
WordPress

And while learning, this project was simultaneously developed with the skills I learned.
